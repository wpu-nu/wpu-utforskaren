Analyze the Palme case with graph theory

The criminal investigation following the assessination of Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986 is one of the world's largest. It is only rivaled by the JFK assassination case and the Lockerbie bombing case. In June 2020 the investigation was closed, without any legal action against any suspect. There are many suspects, many plausible motives, but a significant lack of evidence.


Following the closure of the case a lot of new documents have been released by the authorities in accordance to Swedens Freedom of Information Act. The investigation material consists of some 56 000 documents registered in the main ledger. Some 2-3% have been disclosed. It has been estimated that it would take a trained person 9 years to read through the entirity of the material.

Clearly, reading the material end to end is not the best way to make sense of the information. As the ledger has been released (although heavily redacted) one can deduce the main themes and connections of the investigation. This tool fetches meta data from wpu.nu, that indexes and OCRs the material, and visualises it as a graph.
